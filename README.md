# Halo Gnome Theme

This is a Halo-inspired theme for GNOME desktops, drawing inspiration from the iconic design from Master Chiefs HUD, primarily Halo 3. Required Extensions are OpenBar and Logo Menu, but I have listed others I use down below. OpenBar is the core component for applying this theme. You can import my config which you can use as baseline, and then fine tune it if you want. You can change the highlight color for the pop-up menus and the pop-up menu borders to the same highlight color as the topbar (Saphire #97B5F5) for example.

| Color | Hex-Code | Where to apply |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gold   | #CCAE2C | Highlight |
| Dark Blue | #325992 | Topbar-BG (Gradient) |
| Light Blue | #5588DB | Topbar-BG (Gradient) |
| Light Blue effect (Saphire)  | #97B5F5 | Topbar Highlight |
| White | #DEDEDE | Text |
| Steel | #626262 | Ränder |
| Cobalt | #5588DB | Accents |
| Orange | #9B3332 | Menu Highlight |

## Logo Menu

Install the extension Logo Menu and choose the MCC helmet icon from the files.

## Alpha-Values for Transparency

The alpha value (transparency) determines how transparent the top bar and pop-up menus are, with 0.0 being completely transparent and 1.0 being completely opaque. A range of 0.7 to 0.9 **(70-90% opacity) is appropriate** to allow the background to show through slightly without affecting readability. The foreground alpha (FG Alpha) should remain at 1.00 to display text and icons clearly.

## Animations

Install [Burn-My-Windows](https://github.com/Schneegans/Burn-My-Windows) from Gnome extensions and enable the effect Hexagon. Set the duration/speed to what you desire, but I’d suggest a value between 300-600 ms, so you can see the effect while not having to wait ages for a window to pop up. After that, set the scale to a value of around 1, so it looks more like in Chiefs HUD.

## Problems:

- Don't enable “Apply Accent to Shell allover” and “Apply all Styles to Shell allover” because it leads to ugly boxes in the search results. I haven’t figured out yet, how to prevent that without disabling these options.
- Trilands:
    - I haven’t figured out yet how to control the radius of the left and right parts of the bar to make the sides more diagonal instead of rounded to resemble the shield UI from Halo 1.
    - I don’t know how to get rid of the vertical borders between the elements in the topbar.

## Ideas for the future:

- other color schemes like one based around Mjolnir green or a purple covenant theme
- Install script for easier application
- integration of cursors and original menu sounds (if possible)
- GRUB theme
- creating or integrating live wallpapers for use with Hanabi
